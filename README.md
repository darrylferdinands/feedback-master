#Feed using Meteor.Js

A cloud app, that provides a discussion board to its customers. The application has two screens/pages: 
(1) Landing page is a log-in page, where a customer can provide an email/password to create/log-in into the application, and 
(2) Once the user is authenticated, he is taken to the discussion board, where he can add his/her comment to the feed. 

The feed shows the email ids of the user, and the entered comments in chronological order.

An excellent tutorial to get you started with METEOR framework can be found at (www.meteor.com). Once you get done, host your code on GitHub, and send us the GitHub url.
